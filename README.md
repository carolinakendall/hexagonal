This project was built as an exercise to practice code quality, architecture choices and testing practices.
It is a bank account application implemented using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters).

*The application follows Hexagonal Architecture, organized into:
-Domain: Core business logic
-Ports
      Inbound ports (use cases)
      Outbound ports (repositories)
-Adapters
      Inbound: REST controllers
      Outbound: In-memory persistence
This structure ensures that the domain remains independent of frameworks and technical concerns.

*Features:
   -Bank Account
